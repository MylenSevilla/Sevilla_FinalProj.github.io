<h3> I was able to gain a variety of lessons on managing the enterprise servers of both 
<h3>the Ubuntu and CentOS Linux distributions throughout this course, CPE232 - 
<h3>Managing Enterprise Servers. Understanding DevOps (Development and Operations) and 
<h3>how to set up distant servers utilizing ssh key-based authentication allowed me to 
<h3>connect to them and communicate with them in a secure way. Also, I learned how to set up 
<h3>a git repository using local and remote repositories as well as the significance of Github. 
<h3>Moreover, I discovered how important Ansible is for Computer Engineers to Create Ansible 
<h3>and Ansible Roles As a result of what I learned in this course, I was able to install 
<h3>certain packages. I additionally learned about monitoring tools, containerization, and 
<h3>OpenStack Cloud Services. 
<br>
<br>
<h3>Furthermore, I felt a lot of pressure throughout the entire semester because I had so 
<h3>many excellent classmates in this course. In addition, I was the only lady in my section, 
<h3>which made me feel uncomfortable because I'm not used to interacting with other people, 
<h3>especially men. However, despite the pressure, I can still feel joy since my classmates are 
<h3>polite to one another. And, contrary to what I had thought, our lecturer was friendly, strict, 
<h3>and humorous since he made us feel welcome in his subject. Due to this, I would like to express 
<h3>my sincere gratitude to my instructor, Dr. Jonathan Taylar, for constantly motivating us, for 
<h3>being an excellent teacher, and for guiding us on the right path.
